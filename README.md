# Wine Quality Classification Project

Made by: Nawwaf Anshorulloh Supriyatna

## Overview  
This repository presents a **Wine Quality Classification** project, designed to classify wine quality based on physicochemical properties using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to provide a reproducible, structured workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, enabling researchers or practitioners to explore, refine, and deploy classification models on the wine-quality data.

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the wine quality dataset.  
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms for comparative modeling.  
- Model evaluation using standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  
- Modular code structure to facilitate extension (e.g., additional algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, different cutoff thresholds).

## Dataset  
The dataset used is the widely-used “Wine Quality” dataset (e.g., red and/or white wine data) that consists of physicochemical testing attributes (such as acidity, sulphates, alcohol content) and a quality score as the target variable.  
Typical input features include: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.  
The target variable: quality (an integer score, commonly from 0–10, or as defined in the dataset).

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python version 3.8 or higher (recommended).  
- Virtual environment (venv, conda, or similar) to isolate dependencies.  
- Required Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
