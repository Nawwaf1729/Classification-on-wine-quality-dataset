This is my project of middle test in classification of wine quality dataset using ensemble learning XGBoost, machine learning Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

There are two dataset labeled and unlabeled in folder Datasets.

You can see the classification project in folder Model-predictions and the results in folder Results . There are explanation and interpretation in each cell and results.

Hope you got the insight of my project:)
