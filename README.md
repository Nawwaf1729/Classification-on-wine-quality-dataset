This is my project of middle test in classification of wine quality dataset using ensemble learning XGBoost, machine learning Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

There are two dataset labeled and unlabeled.

You can see the classification project in the ipynb file. There are explanation and interpretation in each cell and results.

Hope you got the insight of my project:)
